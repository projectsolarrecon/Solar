# Google Analytics Setup Guide for SOLAR Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Site is Ready for Analytics!

I've integrated Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking into your SOLAR Project website. Here's how to complete the setup:

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Setup:

### 1. Create Your Google Analytics Account
- Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
- Sign in with your Google account (or create one)
- Click "Start measuring"
- Enter account name: "SOLAR Project" (or your preferred name)

### 2. Set Up Your Property
- **Property name**: "SOLAR Project Website"
- **Reporting time zone**: Choose your location
- **Currency**: USD (or your preference)
- Click "Next"

### 3. Business Information
- **Industry category**: "Law & Government" or "Non-profit"
- **Business size**: Select appropriate size
- **How you plan to use Analytics**: Check relevant boxes
- Click "Create"

### 4. Choose Your Platform
- Select "Web"
- Enter your website URL (you'll get this when you publish)
- **Stream name**: "SOLAR Project Main Site"
- Click "Create stream"

### 5. Get Your Measurement ID
- You'll see a **Measurement ID** like: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`
- **Copy this ID** - you'll need it for the next step

## ðŸ”§ Final Configuration:

### Replace the Placeholder ID:
Once you have your Measurement ID, I'll need to update two files in your project:

1. **In `index.html`**: Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual ID
2. **In `GoogleAnalytics.tsx`**: Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual ID

**Just share your Measurement ID with me and I'll make these updates!**
