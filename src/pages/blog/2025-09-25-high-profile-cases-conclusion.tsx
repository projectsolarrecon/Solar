              The registry doesn‚Äôt fail by accident ‚Äî it fails by design. It
              creates the illusion of safety while scapegoating people who‚Äôve
              already repaid their debt, all while hiding systemic risks in
              authority, trust, and access. True prevention requires oversight
              and accountability, not dots on a map.

            The registry tells a simple story: danger looks like a stranger,
            danger is predictable, danger can be quarantined by drawing dots on
            a map. But every domain we explored told a different story‚Äîone that
            should unsettle anyone who genuinely cares about children‚Äôs safety.

              <strong>Politicians</strong> write laws in the name of ‚Äúpublic
              safety,‚Äù then break those very laws in back rooms and hotel
              suites. The same lawmakers who push registry expansions have, in
              too many cases, been exposed as predators themselves. The registry
              diverts attention away from this hypocrisy.
