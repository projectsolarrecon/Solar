              The registry doesn‚Äôt fail by accident ‚Äî it fails by design. It
              creates the illusion of safety while scapegoating people who‚Äôve
              already repaid their debt, all while hiding systemic risks in
              authority, trust, and access. True prevention requires oversight
              and accountability, not dots on a map.

          <p>
            The registry tells a simple story: danger looks like a stranger,
            danger is predictable, danger can be quarantined by drawing dots on
            a map. But every domain we explored told a different story‚Äîone that
            should unsettle anyone who genuinely cares about children‚Äôs safety.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Politicians</strong> write laws in the name of ‚Äúpublic
              safety,‚Äù then break those very laws in back rooms and hotel
              suites. The same lawmakers who push registry expansions have, in
              too many cases, been exposed as predators themselves. The registry
              diverts attention away from this hypocrisy.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Police and judges</strong> wear the uniforms of authority,
              yet case after case has shown them exploiting their positions.
              Uniforms and gavels create a presumption of trust that predators
              use as cover. Meanwhile, the registry props them up as guardians
              while ignoring their betrayal of power. A national study
              documented over 1,000 sworn officers arrested for sex-related
              crimes between 2005‚Äì2014, almost none tracked by the registry.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clergy</strong> preach morality while shuffling predators
              quietly between parishes. For decades, internal memos and sealed
              files reveal decisions to prioritize reputation over children.
              Instead of demanding accountability from institutions that command
              enormous trust, the registry whispers, ‚Äúlook over there.‚Äù The
              Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report documented over 300 priests abusing
              1,000+ children, with bishops protecting perpetrators.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Schools and sports</strong>‚Äîplaces where children are
              supposed to be safest‚Äîbecome breeding grounds for abuse because
              authority and access converge. Coaches, teachers, and mentors
              exploit the reverence of their roles. Yet public headlines and
              fear campaigns continue to shift the spotlight back to strangers.
              The DOJ‚Äôs Inspector General found that the FBI failed to act on
              credible reports about Larry Nassar, enabling years of abuse.
              Survivors testified: ‚ÄúEveryone knew. No one stopped it.‚Äù
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Doctors</strong> swear to ‚Äúdo no harm‚Äù but too often
              escape oversight when they exploit patients. Medical boards
              protect their own, and survivors are often silenced. The registry,
              built to track those already punished, has nothing to say about
              systemic failure in medicine. A Federation of State Medical Boards
              report found structural barriers that let physicians disciplined
              for sexual misconduct continue practicing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Employers and neighbors</strong> have daily, unsupervised
              access to kids‚Äîhiring babysitters, running after-school programs,
              supervising summer jobs. These contexts make abuse possible, but
              invisible. The registry hides these everyday risks. The EEOC
              records thousands of sexual harassment and abuse complaints each
              year, many involving supervisors and coworkers.
            </li>
            <li>
              And <strong>families</strong>, the one place children are promised
              unconditional safety, are too often where the deepest betrayals
              occur. Generations of research confirm that abuse is most often
              committed by someone the child knows, loves, or depends on. The
              registry is silent here‚Äîbecause it was never designed to face this
              reality. DOJ/OJJDP reports that 76% of maltreatment perpetrators
              are parents.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This is the equation we found again and again:{" "}
            <strong>Authority + Access + Trust = Vulnerability.</strong>
          </p>

          <Divider label="A Weapon of Mass Distraction" />
          <p>
            It‚Äôs tempting to say the registry ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù But that‚Äôs the
            wrong frame. It does work. It works exactly as intended. It
            redirects fear, manufactures the illusion of safety, shields
            powerful institutions, and gives politicians cover. Ineffectiveness
            is the design. The registry was never meant to protect children. It
            was meant to reassure the public while distracting from where the
            danger actually lives.
          </p>

          <BandHeader title="How This Aligns with SOLAR‚Äôs Position" icon="üåû" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Registries are ineffective and harmful.</strong> Most new
              offenses come from people not on the registry, while those on it
              reoffend at lower rates than most other felonies. DOJ found a 5.3%
              sexual re-arrest rate over 3 years in its landmark study, far
              lower than burglary or robbery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Registries are punitive in practice.</strong> They impose
              lifelong collateral consequences that keep people in cycles of
              instability‚Äîmaking society less safe, not more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Registries foster fear and scapegoating.</strong> They
              create an underclass, redirecting blame instead of addressing
              systemic risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety requires prevention and accountability.</strong>{" "}
              That means oversight of authority, education, treatment, and
              support‚Äînot maps of people who have already repaid their debt.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <Divider label="The Final Word" />
          <p>
            The registry is not a broken system. It is a system that works
            against prevention, accountability, and truth. It is a mirror turned
            the wrong way‚Äîreflecting dots of people who‚Äôve repaid their debt,
            while the real danger sits behind pulpits, badges, locker rooms,
            exam tables, and dinner tables. If we keep staring at the map, we
            will never see the truth.
