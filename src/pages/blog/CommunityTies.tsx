        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Parents like to believe that work is a safe place for their kids to grow up. A job scooping fries at the golden arches, folding shirts at the mall, or babysitting a toddler across the street carries the promise of independence and a paycheck. We‚Äôve woven it into our cultural fabric: teenagers learning responsibility, savings accounts opened with that first deposit, college applications sprinkled with ‚Äúpart-time work‚Äù in the activities section. But what if those very environments‚Äîrestaurants, retail counters, living rooms‚Äîare where the danger really lives?
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
          The uncomfortable truth is that employers, whether multinational corporations or neighborhood parents, have been at the center of some of the most devastating cases of sexual abuse of teenagers. Yet public policy and the registry system keep looking elsewhere. We track strangers on maps and pile up restrictions around bus stops while ignoring the places where teens actually spend their hours: in uniforms, behind counters, in stockrooms, or in someone else‚Äôs home.
