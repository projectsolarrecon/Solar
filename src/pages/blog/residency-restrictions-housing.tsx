> <article className="prose prose-slate max-w-none"> <Callout variant="info" title="TL;DR" icon="üîé"> <p> Residency restrictions limit where certain people may live (for example, setting 1,000‚Äì2,500 ft buffers around schools and parks). Evidence shows they rarely reduce re-offense, but they do increase homelessness and housing churn. Stable housing is protective; blanket exclusion is not.

      These laws create geographic ‚Äúno‚Äëlive‚Äù zones that can cover large portions of a city. In practice, they shrink the affordable housing map to a few pockets‚Äîoften far from transit and services. Reviews published by the U.S. Department of Justice‚Äôs National Institute of Justice indicate such rules {""}

    <BandHeader title="How They Erode Stability" icon="üìâ" />
    <p>
      When entire neighborhoods are off‚Äëlimits, people compete for a tiny set of legal addresses. Landlords and screeners add private barriers. The result is frequent moves, doubled‚Äëup living, or homelessness. The {""}
      <a className={linkCls} href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/housing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prison Policy Initiative</a> documents how reentry is already a gauntlet‚Äîresidency bans compound the risk of eviction and unsheltered homelessness.

      Evidence from the DOJ‚Äôs {""}
      <a className={linkCls} href="https://smart.ojp.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMART Office</a> and NIJ does not support population‚Äëwide buffers as a crime‚Äëprevention strategy. Instability and homelessness, by contrast, are associated with higher risk‚Äîmeaning restrictions can be counterproductive.

    <BandHeader title="Better Approaches" icon="üå±" />
    <p>
      Replace blanket buffers with individualized assessment, supportive housing, and Housing First models; pair with supervision and services tailored to risk and need. These approaches improve stability and align with constitutional limits that courts have applied to excessive exclusion.

    <Callout variant="policy" title="Policy Note" icon="üìú">
      Jurisdictions should require evidence that any restriction meaningfully advances safety and avoids de facto banishment. Many courts scrutinize broad zones that sever access to housing, work, and family.
