          It starts with a photo op. A state legislator stands beside uniformed officers and survivor advocates,
          cameras flashing as he pledges to ‚Äúget tough‚Äù on predators. The next scene is quieter: a private meeting with
          union lobbyists and vendor reps who promise campaign support‚Äîso long as registry expansion and lifetime
          supervision stay untouched.

          What looks like moral resolve on television is, behind the curtain, a business negotiation. This isn‚Äôt
          incompetence or corruption in the cinematic sense. It‚Äôs design: a coalition of institutions that profit when
          punishment never ends.

          Every player‚Äîguards, prosecutors, corporations, politicians‚Äîhas built a financial, bureaucratic, and political

          Police and prison unions learned long ago that fear is more reliable than dues. The California Correctional
          Peace Officers Association (CCPOA) spent millions in the 1990s pushing for the state‚Äôs Three Strikes law and
          killing parole reform efforts (

          When lawmakers float registry reform or parole expansion, the unions descend on statehouses with coordinated
          messaging about ‚Äúpublic safety.‚Äù Reformers get painted as reckless, even when their data come straight from
          the Department of Justice. Legislators cave because no one wants to be the next ‚Äúsoft on crime‚Äù headline.
