> <article className="prose prose-slate max-w-none"> <BandHeader title="The Weight of Sexual Harm" icon="💔" /> <p> Every year, countless lives are shattered by sexual harm. Some stories make headlines — the kidnapped child, the high-profile trial, the viral testimony. But many more never do. Behind closed doors, survivors carry trauma that reverberates for decades. </p> <p> The impact varies but is always profound. Children who endure abuse often face long-term struggles with trust, intimacy, mental health, and even physical well-being. Adults assaulted by partners or colleagues grapple with betrayal layered atop injury. Survivors of online exploitation describe a torment without end — images replicated endlessly. Others are wounded most by betrayal from someone trusted: a teacher, pastor, or family friend. </p> <p> These crimes fracture families and destabilize communities. Survivors often wrestle with depression, PTSD, and career disruption. Some turn to substances just to quiet the echoes of what was done. This pain cannot be minimized. And because the harm is so devastating, our responses matter. </p>

<Callout variant="info" title="Why It Matters" icon="ℹ️">
      Public registries and residency bans were created in survivors’ names — but
      they often compound harm instead of preventing it.

      Patty Wetterling’s son Jacob was abducted in 1989, spurring the federal Jacob
      Wetterling Act — the framework for sex offender registries. But over time,
      Patty came to question what that legacy produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 2016 she said: *“Locking them up forever, labeling them, and not allowing
      them community support doesn’t work. I’ve turned 180 degrees from where I
      was.”* (<a className={linkCls} href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2016/10/04/sex-offender-registries-wetterling-abduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APM Reports</a>)

      “No more victims” means demanding prevention strategies that actually work —
      not laws that create new harm.

    <p>
      Polly Klaas’s sisters, Jess and Annie, lost their sibling to abduction and
      murder in 1993. While their father became a prominent advocate of tough-on-crime
      policies, the sisters grew into activists with a different vision.

      They advocate for prevention, accountability, and healing — not policies that
      expand mass incarceration in Polly’s name.

    <BandHeader title="A Registry That Speaks in Silence" icon="📉" />
    <p>
      Research shows registries do little to prevent sexual violence. Studies find
      no clear reduction in recidivism, while destabilization — housing loss,
      unemployment, stigma — increases reoffense risk.
    </p>
    <Callout variant="urgent" title="Policy Failure" icon="⚠️">
      The registry reassures the public — but offers little measurable safety
      benefit.

    <p>
      If punishment fails, what works? Restorative justice offers frameworks for
      accountability, repair, and transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programs like Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA) show recidivism
      reductions of 70–80%, while saving communities money. Survivors who
      participate often report greater healing and voice compared to the courtroom.

      “Accountability that heals is stronger than punishment that fails.”

    <BandHeader title="Collateral Wounds" icon="🎯" />
    <p>
      Punitive registries harm not just registrants but their families. Children of
      registrants often face bullying, forced moves, and lost opportunities.

    <Callout variant="reminder" title="Unintended Harm" icon="👶">
      In the name of protecting children, registry laws are actively harming
      children.
