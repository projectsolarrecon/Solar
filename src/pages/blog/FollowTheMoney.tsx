        <p>
          If you follow the money in the U.S. criminal justice system, one truth
          becomes clear: <strong>punishment isn‚Äôt just a policy‚Äîit‚Äôs an economy.</strong>{" "}
          Entire sectors depend on a steady stream of arrests, prosecutions, and
          long sentences to keep their budgets flush and their payrolls intact.
          Nowhere is this clearer‚Äîor more grotesque‚Äîthan in the world of
          sex-offense policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Registries, mandatory minimums, endless supervision, GPS ankle
          monitors, mandatory therapy, drug tests, polygraphs, and
          ‚Äúaccountability‚Äù apps‚Äîeach layer is billed as protection for the
          public. But each is also a <strong>revenue stream.</strong> Agencies
          collect fees. Vendors sign contracts. Unions lobby for stricter laws
          and bigger headcounts. And families of people with sex-offense
          convictions foot the bill‚Äîoften literally, in the form of monthly
          payments just to remain compliant.
        </p>

          ‚ÄúThe system gets paid when people stay stuck‚Äîincarcerated, supervised,

        <p>
          The incentives are perverse. In a system where real success would mean{" "}
          <em>fewer people harmed and fewer people locked up</em>, the financial
          rewards flow in the opposite direction. The system thrives on
          permanence.

          This series follows the money‚Äîtracing how police unions, prison
          guards, prosecutors, private contractors, and treatment vendors shape
          narratives about <em>‚Äúpredators‚Äù</em> and <em>‚Äúforever risk‚Äù</em> to
          secure their own bottom line.

        <p>
          At the core of sex-offense policy is an{" "}
          <strong>infrastructure of perpetual management.</strong> Unlike most
          convictions, these carry lifetime consequences that extend far beyond
          a sentence. That permanence makes the field unusually fertile for
          bureaucracies and vendors who profit from ongoing surveillance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The turning point was the{" "}
          <strong>
            Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006
          </strong>
          , which included the{" "}
          <strong>Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)</strong>
          . Congress built a carrot-and-stick system: states that didn‚Äôt
          ‚Äúsubstantially implement‚Äù SORNA risked losing{" "}
          <strong>
            10% of their Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne-JAG) funding
          </strong>{" "}
          ‚Äîone of the largest federal law-enforcement grants (

          ).
        </p>

        <p>
          That penalty wasn‚Äôt symbolic: for many states, it meant millions in
          lost dollars. Even holdouts were eventually pushed into building
          larger registries and enforcement bureaucracies (

          ).
        </p>

        <p>
          Once SORNA took hold, the <strong>machinery multiplied.</strong>{" "}
          County sheriffs built <em>‚Äúsex-offender units.‚Äù</em> Probation and
          parole agencies expanded caseloads. Prosecutors found steady work
          litigating compliance cases. Expert witnesses filled court calendars.
          And treatment vendors discovered a stream of{" "}
          <em>mandated clients</em>‚Äîalways billed back to defendants.
