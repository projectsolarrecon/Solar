          <p>
            Pop culture has long thrived on depictions of child sexuality, underage relationships,
            and exploitative dynamics — from <strong><i>Lolita</i></strong> to <strong><i>Game of Thrones</i></strong>, 
            from <strong><i>Taxi Driver</i></strong> to <strong><i>Euphoria</i></strong>, from Beatles lyrics to Karol G’s <strong><i>+57</i></strong>. These works are celebrated as classics, awarded, and sold by the millions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet ordinary people who commit or even imagine similar acts face prison, public registries, and lifelong exile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The issue is not whether these works should be censored — it’s the <strong>hypocrisy</strong> of a society that tolerates exploitation when wrapped in art, while demanding absolute condemnation when lived by the powerless.

        <p>
          Sex crimes are serious. They cause harm, and there is no excuse for them. Nothing in this piece asks you to forget that or to instantly forgive everything anyone has ever done.
        </p>

        <p>
          What this piece <strong>does</strong> ask is that we confront a hypocrisy most people would rather ignore.
        </p>

        <p>
          We live in a culture that condemns certain people to registries, surveillance, and lifelong stigma — while at the same time celebrating art, film, television, and music that include the very themes society claims to abhor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nabokov’s <strong><i>Lolita</i></strong> is treated as a literary masterpiece. <strong><i>Taxi Driver</i></strong> and <strong><i>Pretty Baby</i></strong> are fixtures of film history. <strong><i>Euphoria</i></strong> wins Emmys. Songs about teenage girls fill our playlists. Elvis remains “The King.” These aren’t fringe examples—they are pillars of our modern culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          The contradiction is unavoidable. If depictions of exploitation were truly intolerable, our shelves, playlists, and watchlists would be stripped bare. But they are not. We rarely cancel the books, movies, or songs — because we don’t want to. We find excuses, gloss over, or pretend not to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is the point. The issue is not whether these works should be banned or burned. It is that society chooses to tolerate them, even adore them, while denying that same possibility of tolerance to people on registries.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            If we can accept these works as part of our culture, then at the very least we must admit: our outrage is selective, our punishments inconsistent, and our moral compass bends under convenience.
          </strong>

        <p>
          If society truly believed that depictions of sexual exploitation were intolerable, our bookshelves and cultural touchstones would look very different. Yet the literary canon has long embraced works that normalize, glamorize, or at least linger on sexual encounters between children and adults.
        </p>

        <p>
          These same depictions, if acted upon in real life, would be criminal offenses resulting in prison and a lifetime on the registry. <strong>The hypocrisy is staggering.</strong>
        </p>

        <PullQuote>
          “The same society that demands ‘zero tolerance’ for sex crimes has no problem elevating works that center underage sexuality as cultural treasures.”
        </PullQuote>

        <p>
          Take <strong><i>Lolita</i></strong> (1955) by Vladimir Nabokov, often lauded for its prose, narrative complexity, and cultural impact. But at its heart, it’s the story of a 37-year-old man’s sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl. You can explore more context at Britannica’s overview of *Lolita*. 0
        </p>

        <p>
          Critics write entire essays on its meaning; it appears on “greatest novel” lists and has been adapted into multiple films. Yet the same society demanding zero tolerance for sex crimes still elevates *Lolita* as a literary treasure.
        </p>

        <Callout variant="info" title="Literary Contradiction" icon="📘">
          <p>
            *Lolita* is banned in some countries, yet widely embraced in the U.S. and Europe as a “masterpiece.” This inconsistency highlights how moral judgments shift drastically when framed as “art.”
          </p>
        </Callout>

        <p>
          Aldous Huxley’s <strong><i>Brave New World</i></strong> (1932) is celebrated for its social satire and futuristic vision. But beneath its dystopia lies a society that intentionally sexualizes children early, encouraging experimentation before adulthood. You can read more about its themes on Britannica. 1
        </p>

        <p>
          We praise it as prescient, rarely acknowledging how its fictional world normalizes child sexuality as background detail.
        </p>

        <p>
          The point isn’t that these books are dangerous in themselves—but that they expose a profound cultural double standard. When wrapped in “art,” the same material is defended, discussed, even elevated. When played out in real life, the participants are locked away and thrust onto registries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider <strong><i>It</i></strong> (1986) by Stephen King. One contestable scene involves an encounter among 11-year-olds—so controversial that it was removed entirely from the 2017 and 2019 film adaptations. Many millions still read it in full.
        </p>

        <p>
          Adaptations fear the backlash of showing it onscreen, but readers willingly turn pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          George R.R. Martin’s <strong><i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i></strong> series—adapted into HBO’s <strong><i>Game of Thrones</i></strong>—pushes the same tension. In the books, Daenerys is 13 and Sansa is 11 when their sexual arcs begin. On screen, HBO aged them: Daenerys is ~17, Sansa middle teens. The showrunners knew raw portrayal would spark outrage. You can read more in *Time*’s comparison of book vs. show. 2
        </p>

        <Callout variant="research" title="Book vs. Screen Ages" icon="🔎">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Daenerys: 13 in the novel → ~17 onscreen</li>
            <li>Sansa: 11 in the novel → mid-teens onscreen</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ⚠️ The adaptation quietly “corrected” what audiences would reject—proof that literature and TV abide by different moral rules.
          </p>
        </Callout>

        <p>
          Even seemingly benign “inspirational fiction” slips across the line. Garth Stein’s <strong><i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i></strong> (2008), later adapted into a Disney-backed film, contains a subplot in which a 15-year-old girl aggressively pursues the adult narrator. This subplot was erased from the film adaptation, but it remains in the popular novel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The encounter is narrated through the family dog’s eyes, dwelling on her physicality and desires. It becomes a crucial plot point in the novel (impacting custody, future prospects). For more on “Annika,” see its LitCharts character analysis. 3
        </p>

        <Callout variant="success" title="Publishing Reality" icon="🐾">
          <p>
            Publishers and studios know audiences will forgive what they <i>read</i> but balk at what they <i>see</i>. That selective outrage reveals hypocrisy, not principle.
          </p>
        </Callout>

        <p>
          This contradiction undercuts the moral absolutism of sex-crime policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Society accepts—or even venerates—depictions of child sexuality in literature across genres, while demanding that any comparable behavior in real life be met with permanent stigma, surveillance, and exile.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            The issue isn’t whether these books should be banned—but whether society can admit its outrage is selective. If *Lolita* can be a revered masterpiece while registrants are condemned as monsters, then what we are really enforcing is not morality but hypocrisy.
