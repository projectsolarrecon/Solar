            Violent offenders ‚Äî including child killers ‚Äî are often paroled quietly after surprisingly short sentences, with no public registry or ongoing oversight. Meanwhile, non-violent federal sex offenders serve longer terms and live under lifelong restrictions and registration. The result: a justice system that punishes visibility, not violence.

            Ronald Exantus‚Äôs recent parole made headlines this week ‚Äî the man who broke into a Kentucky home and killed a 6-year-old child will be fully free by June 2026, with no public registry, no restrictions, and no trace. It‚Äôs shocking, but it‚Äôs not an anomaly. This post isn‚Äôt about one case; it‚Äôs about the pattern. When murderers are quietly reintegrated while non-violent offenders remain marked for life, something in our definition of ‚Äújustice‚Äù has gone very wrong.

        <p className="mt-6">
          Imagine a world where a man who murdered a child in cold blood is quietly released back onto your street, no public registry to warn you ‚Äì while another man, who never laid a hand on anyone but possessed illegal images, is imprisoned for over a decade and will be branded for life on a public list. This isn‚Äôt a dystopian novel; it‚Äôs reality in the American justice system. Violent offenders, including child killers, often serve surprisingly short prison terms and re-enter society with little fanfare, <strong>no requirement to register or notify the public</strong>, and minimal supervision. Meanwhile, non-violent federal sex offenders (like those convicted of possessing or sharing child sexual abuse material) face long prison sentences, lifetime supervised release, and permanent inclusion on sex offender registries. The contrast is jarring ‚Äì and it raises uncomfortable questions about how we prioritize punishment and public safety.

          <strong>Ronald Exantus (Kentucky)</strong> ‚Äì In 2015, Exantus broke into a family‚Äôs home and stabbed 6-year-old Logan Tipton to death as the boy slept. He also attacked Logan‚Äôs father and sisters. A jury found Exantus ‚Äúguilty but mentally ill‚Äù on assault charges (he was found not guilty by reason of insanity for the murder itself) and he received a 20-year sentence in 2018. Shockingly, Exantus was <strong>paroled after serving only about 7 years</strong> behind bars. Records show he was released on <strong>Oct 1, 2025</strong>, thanks to generous good-behavior and education credits. His mandatory parole supervision will end by <strong>June 18, 2026</strong>, at which point he walks free with no further oversight. There will be no requirement for Exantus to register on any public list after his sentence expires. As Logan‚Äôs outraged father put it, <em>‚ÄúIt just seems like a 6-year-old‚Äôs life is worth more than 10 years in prison‚Äù</em> ‚Äì yet by next year, his child‚Äôs killer will be out of the system entirely.

          <strong>Herbert David Brown III (California)</strong> ‚Äì Brown beat his 22-month-old daughter, Lily, so badly that she died from a fractured skull and other injuries in 2013. He pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in 2015 and was sentenced to 15-to-life in prison. Under California‚Äôs parole system (enhanced by Proposition 57‚Äôs ‚Äúrehabilitation‚Äù credits), Brown became eligible far earlier than 15 years. In October 2024, despite fierce objections from the local District Attorney and Lily‚Äôs grieving mother, a parole board <strong>granted Brown parole after about 12 years</strong> in custody. In April 2025, that decision was upheld ‚Äì clearing the way for Brown‚Äôs release well before the minimum term of his sentence. Brown will <strong>not appear on any public offender registry</strong> after release. The local DA condemned the outcome as ‚Äúshameful.‚Äù

          <strong>Jeffrey Powell (California)</strong> ‚Äì In January 2013, while already on parole for prior offenses, Powell committed a <strong>home-invasion murder</strong>. He and accomplices kicked in the door of a Citrus Heights home in the middle of the night; Powell repeatedly stabbed 52-year-old Jack Swaim, who bled to death while his son and mother tried to save him. A jury convicted Powell in 2015 of second-degree murder and burglary; he received a <strong>16-years-to-life</strong> sentence. Yet in October 2023, after only about 10 years in prison, Powell was <strong>granted early parole</strong> ‚Äì roughly a 40% reduction of his minimum term. California‚Äôs parole board approved his release in spite of Powell‚Äôs extensive prison misconduct (including leading a white-supremacist gang). By April 2024, the parole grant was finalized. Powell ‚Äì an admittedly violent individual with a 23-year criminal history ‚Äì is being freed with <strong>no requirement to register</strong> as a violent offender.

          Contrast the above with how the system treats non-violent <strong>federal sex offenders</strong>, particularly those involved in <strong>child sexual-abuse material (CSAM)</strong>. These offenses are serious, but they do not involve physical contact; often the crime is possessing or sharing illegal files online. Yet federal sentencing policy is extremely harsh.

          </a>
          , the average sentence for simply <strong>possessing</strong> CSAM is about <strong>82 months</strong> (~6.8 years). For <strong>distribution or trafficking</strong>, the average is roughly <strong>151 months</strong> (~12.6 years). Many serve longer due to <strong>mandatory minimums</strong> ‚Äî typically 5-, 10-, or 15-year terms.

          The <strong>disparity is stark</strong>. A man who violently took a child‚Äôs life can walk free after a few years and quietly blend back into society, <strong>unregistered and anonymous</strong>. Meanwhile, a man who clicked on or shared illegal images will serve a sentence comparable to or longer than many murderers ‚Äî and even after release he will never escape the <strong>scarlet letter</strong> of sex-offender status, his name and crime forever one Google search away.
