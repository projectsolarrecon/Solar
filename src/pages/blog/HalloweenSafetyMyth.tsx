    <p className="mt-6"><strong>No verified Halloween sex-crime spike</strong> — <em><a className={linkCls} href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19581428/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Safe Are Trick-or-Treaters?</a></em> found no increase in nonfamilial child sexual offenses on or around October 31, and questioned devoting policing to a problem that “does not appear to exist.”</p>
    <p className="mt-6"><strong>Zero documented trick-or-treat assaults by registrants</strong> — despite layered media, policy, and legal discourse, no credible case exists of a registered sex offender assaulting a trick-or-treater.</p>
    <p className="mt-6"><strong>Compelled-sign mandates struck down</strong> — in Butts County, GA, the <a className={linkCls} href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/202110092.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11th Circuit</a> invalidated sheriff-planted yard signs in <em>McClendon v. Long</em> as unconstitutional compelled speech; in Missouri, a <a className={linkCls} href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-moed-4_23-cv-01242/pdf/USCOURTS-moed-4_23-cv-01242-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal court in 2024</a> struck the “No Candy” sign requirement (though left curfew and lights-off intact).</p>
    <p className="mt-6"><strong>Drunk driving dominates Halloween fatalities</strong> — from 2019–2023, 198 people died in alcohol-related crashes on Halloween night; 176 involved drivers with BAC ≥ 0.08 (<a className={linkCls} href="https://www.trafficsafetymarketing.gov/safety-topics/drunk-driving/buzzed-driving-drunk-driving/halloween" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traffic Safety Marketing / NHTSA</a>).</p>
    <p className="mt-6"><strong>Traffic fatalities and impaired driving more broadly</strong> — about 30% of U.S. traffic deaths involve drunk drivers (<a className={linkCls} href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA “Drunk Driving” stats</a>).</p>
    <p className="mt-6"><strong>Pedestrian risk surges</strong> — a <em><a className={linkCls} href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2711459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JAMA Pediatrics</a></em> analysis shows pedestrian-fatality risk ≈ 43% higher on Halloween night than on control evenings.</p>
    <p className="mt-6"><strong>Repeat DUI offenders compound risk</strong> — drivers with prior impaired-driving convictions are disproportionately represented among fatal crashes (<a className={linkCls} href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA</a>).</p>

    <Divider label="I. Myth Versus Record" />
    <BandHeader title="Myth Versus Record" icon="🧩" />
    <p className="mt-6">Policymakers routinely assume that Halloween is a window of opportunity for known sexual offenders to strike. But all rigorous temporal analyses contradict that assumption. <em>Chaffin et al.</em> controlled for seasonal and day-of-week variations across 67,045 non-familial sexual offenses against children and found <strong>no Halloween-associated spike</strong>, undermining the claim that predators coordinate attacks with trick-or-treat timing.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">No court opinion, news investigation, or academic survey has unearthed a case where a registered offender assaulted a trick-or-treater on October 31. The red-dot maps, nightly alerts, and neighborhood apps broadcast threats that the public record does not support.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">When registrants are told to turn off lights or post placards, they’re being disciplined over a threat that has never manifested in the empirical record. The policy is rhetorical, not preventive.</p>

    <BandHeader title="What Actually Spikes: Cars, Alcohol, and Recidivism" icon="🚗" />
    <p className="mt-6">Children walking between houses after dark are vulnerable. The <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> study shows that Halloween night sees ~43% more pedestrian deaths than matched control nights (same weekday, one week before and after). The surge is consistent, measurable, and significant.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">Costume glare, masks, low visibility, and unlit streets intensify the danger—but it is the cars, not registry addresses, doing the killing.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">Between 2019 and 2023, NHTSA data show that <strong>198 people died in alcohol-related crashes</strong> on Halloween night, with <strong>176 involving legally drunk drivers (BAC ≥ 0.08)</strong>. Among those victims were 30 pedestrians (<a className={linkCls} href="https://www.trafficsafetymarketing.gov/safety-topics/drunk-driving/buzzed-driving-drunk-driving/halloween" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traffic Safety Marketing / NHTSA</a>).</p>
    <p className="mt-6">More broadly, impaired drivers are involved in roughly 30% of all U.S. traffic fatalities (<a className={linkCls} href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA “Drunk Driving” stats</a>).</p>
    <p className="mt-6">Crucially, drivers with prior DUI convictions are far likelier to appear in fatal-crash data. That means Halloween’s lethal risks are concentrated among a known-danger population—yet policy attention zeroes in on registry addresses instead.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">If we are going to marshal public “fear of danger to kids,” let it be aimed at repeat DUI drivers—not registry addresses unconnected to any documented harm.</p>

  The following real-world ordinances illustrate how Halloween-specific “safety”
  laws have spread across the country, often forcing registrants to darken homes,
  post warning signs, or stay inside under threat of arrest. These policies are
  presented as child protection, but none have empirical evidence showing they
  prevent harm.

  These laws show a national pattern of symbolic enforcement—rules designed to
  visually display “safety” rather than reduce measurable risk. In every case, the
  supposed threat (a trick-or-treat assault by a registrant) has never been observed,
  yet entire local police operations are built around preventing it.

    <Divider label="IV. Constitutional Fault Lines" />
    <BandHeader title="Constitutional Fault Lines" icon="⚖️" />
    <p className="mt-6">The Missouri ruling in <a className={linkCls} href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-moed-4_23-cv-01242/pdf/USCOURTS-moed-4_23-cv-01242-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Sanderson v. Bailey</em></a> held that the statute’s sign-posting clause compels expression and therefore violates the First Amendment. The court observed that the sign requirement adds no material safety value and forces registrants to become mouthpieces for a government message.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">In Georgia, <a className={linkCls} href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/202110092.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>McClendon v. Long</em></a> enforced a similar principle: sheriff-planted yard signs constituted compelled speech, and the 11th Circuit struck them.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">Policies applying Halloween restrictions to registrants whose convictions predate the laws raise serious ex post facto and due-process issues (<a className={linkCls} href="https://clearinghouse.net/case/11188/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Doe v. Nixon</em></a>). Missouri’s <em>F.R. v. St. Charles County</em> similarly held retroactive enforcement unconstitutional.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">Though no Supreme Court case addresses Halloween restrictions directly, <a className={linkCls} href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-1194" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Packingham v. North Carolina</em></a> provides guiding precedent: the Court struck down a blanket ban on social-media access for sex offenders, emphasizing that speech restrictions must be carefully tailored.</p>

    <Divider label="V. Evidence vs. Theater: A Moral Pivot" />
    <BandHeader title="Evidence vs. Theater: A Moral Pivot" icon="🎭" />
    <p className="mt-6">By diverting attention, staff, legal regimes, and public alarm toward registry addresses—houses with no history of harm—we normalize the idea that fear is preventive. But evidence suggests the opposite.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">If the state truly believed curfews, forced signage, and darkened porches meaningfully protected children, logic would demand we apply them to <strong>repeat drunk drivers</strong>—the group far likelier to harm pedestrians at night. Instead, policy silence persists around habitual impaired drivers.</p>
    <p className="mt-6"><em>Operation Boo</em> reflects this inversion. The California Department of Corrections proudly announces dozens of October arrests—but virtually all are for <strong>technical violations</strong> of curfew, phone rules, or decoration bans, not child victim offenses. The spectacle is policing for symbolism, not mitigation.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">Meanwhile, NHTSA data show that nearly 90% of alcohol-related crash deaths on Halloween involve drivers with BAC ≥ 0.08; the population is not anonymous. The mortal risk is not a mask on a porch, but a drunk behind a wheel.</p>

    <p className="mt-6">Halloween registry restrictions are performative, not protective. The legal burdens they impose—curfews, forced speech, property suppression—rest on a threat that does not show up in crime statistics. Meanwhile, the actual danger is demonstrably on the roads.</p>
    <p className="mt-6">We should dismantle Halloween-specific registry laws and reallocate attention, funding, and enforcement to managing impaired drivers, improving street lighting, enforcing speed limits, stationing crossing guards, and running sober-driving campaigns.</p>
