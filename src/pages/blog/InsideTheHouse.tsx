          Parents tell themselves comforting stories. We teach kids about ‚Äústranger danger,‚Äù consult sex-offender maps, draw wider circles around parks and bus stops, and exhale. But the data‚Äîand the cases that make it to court‚Äîsay the real danger to many children isn‚Äôt lurking out on the sidewalk. It‚Äôs inside the home, or close enough to touch it. The registry, built to soothe a public terrified of the unknown predator, simply doesn‚Äôt map what many victims face: abuse by a parent, stepparent, relative, partner of a parent, or trusted family friend.

But years before that, when he was 14 or 15, Josh admitted to his parents (Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar) that he had inappropriately touched <strong>four of his younger sisters</strong> and a babysitter. The family did not report to law enforcement at that time; disclosures emerged later in civil and media proceedings.
