          A mother sits by the phone, waiting for her son’s fifteen-minute call.  
          He worked an entire day in the prison kitchen to afford it.

          Three giants — <strong>Securus</strong>, <strong>ViaPath (GTL)</strong>, and <strong>ICSolutions</strong> — control nearly the entire market.  
          Their contracts guarantee <em>commission payments</em> to correctional agencies, often <strong>40–65%</strong> of every dollar billed.

  The more families pay, the more agencies profit.  
          Before the <strong>FCC 2024 vote</strong> to cap rates at 6¢ per minute, some jails charged 14¢ a minute;  
          a 15-minute call that should cost 90¢ ran <strong>$8.15</strong>.

          Registrants under supervision see the same scheme: paid <em>secure messaging</em>, GPS data uploads,  
          check-in apps with monthly fees. Connection isn’t criminalized — it’s <strong>commodified and exploited.</strong>

          Tablets were sold as progress — <em>“a classroom in every cell.”</em> Instead, they became jukeboxes.

                        <p className="mt-6">
          In most systems, the “free” tablets offer no accredited courses or therapy modules —

          Education works — and they know it. A <strong>RAND meta-analysis</strong> found that people who receive education while incarcerated

          Inside, contraband phones, vapes, weed, and ice move faster than commissary ramen.  
          Officers run side hustles that would make a cartel blush — and drive off in paid-off sports cars.  
          In 2024, federal investigations in Georgia and Texas uncovered rings of guards smuggling drugs and electronics  
          worth hundreds of thousands. Scarcity breeds black markets; both feed on the same greed.
