            A behind-the-scenes look at how unions, prosecutors, politicians, and private vendors sustain
            America‚Äôs punishment economy. Each has a financial and political incentive to keep punishment perpetual ‚Äî
            and sex-offense policy serves as the perfect model of how fear becomes profit.

          It starts with a photo op. A state legislator stands beside uniformed officers and survivor advocates,
          cameras flashing as he pledges to ‚Äúget tough‚Äù on predators. The next scene is quieter: a private meeting
          with union lobbyists and vendor reps who promise campaign support‚Äîso long as registry expansion and lifetime
          supervision stay untouched.

          What looks like moral resolve on television is, behind the curtain, a business negotiation. This isn‚Äôt
          incompetence or corruption in the cinematic sense. It‚Äôs design: a coalition of institutions that profit when
          punishment never ends.

          Police and prison unions learned long ago that fear is more reliable than dues. The California Correctional
          Peace Officers Association (CCPOA) spent millions in the 1990s pushing for the state‚Äôs Three Strikes law and
          killing parole reform efforts (<a className={linkCls} href="https://law.stanford.edu/index.php?webauth-document=child-page%2F266901%2Fdoc%2Fslspublic%2FDHolwerda_06.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanford Law Review ‚Äì CCPOA & Three Strikes</a>; see also{" "}

        <p className="mt-6">
          When lawmakers float registry reform or parole expansion, the unions descend on statehouses with coordinated
          messaging about ‚Äúpublic safety.‚Äù Reformers get painted as reckless, even when their data come straight from

          Outside the private-prison industry, the resistance to reform is just as entrenched. Correctional-officer
          unions behave like corporate boards, not public servants. They testify against early-release proposals, demand

          The pattern repeats nationally: guard unions lobby to keep facilities full, overtime flowing, and budgets
